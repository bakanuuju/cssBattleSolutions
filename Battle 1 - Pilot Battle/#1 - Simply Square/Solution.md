## #1. Simply Square

### The Code

This is my solution for #1.1.Simply Square.

>*Disclaimer :*
><br/>*This is my own solution and might not be the shortest solution. I'm writing a code that can be easily explain for better understanding of the problem.*


```
<div></div>
<style>
  *{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
  }
  body{
    background:#5d3a3a;
  }
  div{
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    background:#b5e0ba;
  }
</style>
```

### Explanation

First of all, reset the default CSS by putting zero margin and padding on all the elements.
```
*{
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
  }
```
>\* refers to every elements in the HTML

Then change the background color on the body element.
```
body{
    background:#5d3a3a;
  }
```

We are going to make the box using a **div** element. In the upcoming challenges, we are going to use the div elements a lot for this purpose.
```
div{
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    background:#b5e0ba;
  }
```
Set the width and height to 200px and set the background color to the one that is provided and matching to the target.
